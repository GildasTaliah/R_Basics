# R Basics

This project showcases fundamental data manipulation, analysis, and simulation techniques using **R programming language**. It covers various aspects, including vetor operations, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with the Boston dataset from the MASS package, and simulation to estimate the empirical distribution of t-test statistics.

The project begins with introductory exercises focusing on basic vector and list operations in R. Then, it progresses to data analysis using the Boston dataset, where descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and data visualization techniques are applied to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and relationships between variables.

In the simulation phase, the project demonstrates the estimation of the empirical distribution of t-test statistics. This involves generating random samples, conducting t-tests, and collecting resulting statistics to understand the variability of t-test outcomes under different scenarios.
